# House Price Prediction Web Application

Built a Python Flask web app to predict house prices based on number of bedrooms, bathrooms, area, and zip code. Used linear regression, Lasso, and Ridge models to enhance accuracy. The app offers users a simple, data-driven tool to estimate house values with essential features.



This **House Price Prediction** web application uses **Python** and **Flask** to provide property price estimates based on key features such as:

- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms
- House area (in square feet)
- Zip code (location)

Machine learning models like **Linear Regression**, **Lasso**, and **Ridge** are employed to enhance the accuracy of predictions, offering reliable insights for users.
